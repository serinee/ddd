                    <p class="do-animation">Frederic Hardwicke Knight, QSO (12 July 1911 - 25 August 2008) was a London-born photographer,
                        historian and collector who emigrated to New Zealand in 1957 to take up a medical photography
                        position in Dunedin. He lived at Broad Bay until ten months before his death at a Dunedin
                        nursing home. His publications include New Zealand's first comprehensive photographic history,
                        many compilations of early Dunedin and Otago photographs, biographies of several early New
                        Zealand photographers and of British photographer William Russell Sedgfield, three books of
                        architectural history and a seminal history of the Otago Peninsula. He was awarded a QSO in
                        1991. An eccentric polymath, Knight was well known for his striking appearance, his ramshackle
                        Broad Bay cottage crammed with his collections and his self-proclaimed exploits, most notably
                        his claim to have found timbers on Mount Ararat that might have been Noah's Ark.

                    <p>
                        My name is <span class="do-animation">SEAN NAGHIBI</span> and I am a London-based digital designer with a passion for photography
                        and history. One day, out of pure chance while browsing social media for information about
                        Hardwicke Knight, I became acquainted with David Murray, the curator of a Facebook page
                        exploring the built heritage of Dunedin, New Zealand, where Hardwicke Knight spent the second
                        half of his life. David was already posting images from his private collection of Knight’s
                        colour slides.
                        <br><br>
                        I have a special love for mid-century Kodachrome photography and conceived the idea of compiling
                        a selection of Knight’s 1950s work, captured in his native England.
                        <br><br>
                        I approached David to ask whether he would be interested in a possible collaboration. Because of
                        work and family commitments David was a little reluctant at first, but after some persistence on
                        my part he finally agreed, although with no promises in terms of deadlines. A year passed
                        without any plan on how to proceed with the publication. Of course, with David living in New
                        Zealand and me living in London, it was hard to access the files I needed to get started. Given
                        the fact that slides are truly irreplaceable, David was apprehensive about shipping them to me
                        here in England.
                        <br><br>
                        To get the project off the ground he supplied images he had already scanned, including 60
                        depicting England and Wales. He later selected and supplied over 150 further images. THROUGH THE
                        LENS was born! David kindly introduced me to Knight’s biographer, Dunedin writer Meg Davidson.
                        She graciously offered to lend her expertise and wrote the Introduction for this book.
                        <br><br>
                        Almost 9 months after the publication of <span class="do-animation">THROUGH THE LENS,</span> Debbie and myself decided to remake a
                        personally selected book by Hardwicke Knight, published first in 1984, titled <span class="do-animation">"PHOTOGRAPHER".</span>
                        This is my adaptation of of this collection for 2019 & beyond.
                        <br><br>
                        The photographs in this book were taken by Hardwicke Knight between 1921 and 1979. They show not
                        just his interest in recording social history but also demonstrate a creative talent for taking
                        beautiful images. His travels in Spain in the 1950's and Turkey in the 1970's gave him great
                        inspiration and his pictures of London in the 1930's and 40's are a wonderful record of that
                        time.
                        <br><br>
                        I would like to take this opportunity to thank both David, Debbie and Meg for making it possible
                        for these books to be brought to life. I would especially like to thank Simon & Debbie Knight,
                        who generously gave their permission to use their father’s photographs without any hesitation.
                        And lastly I would like to thank Rory Kelly who has supported me throughout this project through
                        his written and technical input.
